1. Open up your application in a preview tab by clicking Window > Share > Application > Open.

2. Open github ( https://github.com/settings/applications/new ), and Create a GitHub app for authentication 
and choose an "Application name". For the homepage URL, paste the URL from your preview tab. 
You'll also paste the URL from your preview tab into "Authorization callback URL", 
then add to it: auth/github/callback

3. GitHub will create an app and present you with a Client ID and a Client Secret. 
Set your .env file's GITHUB_KEY equal to the Client ID, and set your .env file's GITHUB_SECRET equal to the Client Secret. 
Copy the URL from your preview tab and paste it into your .env file as your APP_URL.

4. In your terminal, start MongoDB by entering: "mongod" --smallfiles

5. Open a new terminal tab with the + button above your terminal, then run npm install

6. Run nodemon server.js to start the server. Refresh your preview tab. 
Click "sign in" and accept GitHub's prompt to authorize the application.

7. Create a new GitHub repository. Then copy its .git URL.
Return to c9.io's terminal and set your GitHub remote URL: git remote set-url origin 
followed by the URL you copied from GitHub.

Run git push origin master.

Now tab back to GitHub and refresh, and you'll see that your code is now on GitHub.

    - public/index.html
